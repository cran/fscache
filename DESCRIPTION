Description: Manages a file system cache. Regular files can be moved or copied to the cache folder. Sub-folders can be created in order to organize the files. Files can be located inside the cache using a glob function. Text contents can be easily stored in and retrieved from the cache using dedicated functions. It can be used for an application or a package, as a global cache, or as a per-user cache, in which case the standard OS user cache folder will be used (e.g.: on Linux $HOME/.cache/R/my_app_or_pkg_cache_folder).
